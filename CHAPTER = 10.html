<div>Creating A Facebook Web Traffic Ad
</div></h2>
                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-5">Each one of the steps and strategies we’ve been showing you are the crust of proven Facebook Marketing strategies, but if there’s one thing you learned at the beginning of this training is that paying is a great way to accelerate your results. Now, the first paid strategy we showed you was about promoting a Page post to reach more people, but this time we want to increase the stakes. This time, we are going to show you how to create an advertising campaign to send people from an ad on Facebook straight to your website. Getting Started Facebook has its own self-serve ad platform that lets you create ads with just a few clicks. To access it, all you have to do is to visit the “facebook.com/adsmanager/creation” URL while logged in to your Facebook account. This will take you to the ads manager dashboard, where you can set up your own campaigns like a professional advertiser. Are you ready to do it? Yes? Awesome, let’s get to it! <br><br><strong> Creating A Facebook Traffic Campaign</strong><br> That URL will take you straight to the campaign creation page, where you have to start by selecting the campaign objective. To send traffic from Facebook to your site or a landing page, you have to select “traffic” as your marketing objective. Once you select your objective, scroll down and enter the name of your new campaign into the “campaign name” field, then click on the “set up add account” button. You will be asked to select your “account country”, your “currency”, and your “time zone”. You can click on “continue” to finish setting up your ad account and moving to the campaign set up. <br><br><strong>Setting Up The Ad Set </strong><br>The next step is to set up the ad set. First, enter the name of this ad set into the “ad set name” field. Now select “website” as your traffic destination in the “traffic” section.   Now move to the “audience” section. Here you are going to select your target locations first. Click on the “edit” button in the “locations” section. Type the name of a location into the “add more locations” field and select the location from the results. Now you are going to click on the “edit” button in “age” to select the minimum and maximum age of your audience. Then you are going to repeat this step in the “gender” section to select the gender or genders of your audience. Now click on the “edit” button in the “detailed targeting” section. Just like when you created the promoted page post, here you are going to enter a keyword that defines your audience, and you are going to select an attribute to target from the results. Now move to the “placements” section. There are two placement configurations to choose from. Select “Automatic placements” if you want to show your ad to all types of users on all types of devices across multiple placements, including Instagram and the Audience Network. Or select “edit placements” if you want to select the placements and devices where to show your ads. Now move to the “budget and schedule” section. The optimal configuration here for this type of campaign is to select “daily budget” as the budget strategy, and to select “run my ad set continuously starting today” as the schedule. Then, enter your ad spend into the budget field. This is the amount you’ll spend daily in ads. Now enter the maximum you are willing to pay per each click on your ad into the “cost control” field. If you don’t enter an amount here, Facebook will automatically bid in your behalf and you can end up spending more than you planned! You can click on “continue” to move to the next step after you finish configuring everything on this page. <br><br><strong>Creating The Ad And Launching The Campaign</strong> <br>Now it is time to create the ad creative. Start by entering the name of your ad into the “ad name” field. Now move to the “identity” section. Click on the “Facebook page” menu button and select the Facebook page of your business. Now you are going to select your ad format. There are three ad formats available: “carousel”, “single image or video”, and “collection”. Let’s select “single image or video” to create an ad that is simple to customize. Now move to the “media” section to upload the image or video that you’ll use in your ad. First, click on the “add media” menu button. For this example, we are going to click on “add image” to upload an image to the ad. Now move to the “text and links” section. Here you are going to add your ad copy, your ad title, and your destination URLs. Start by composing your ad copy into the “primary text” field. Next, compose an ad headline into the “headline” field. Now make sure that “website” is selected as the “destination” and enter your website’s or landing page URL into the “website URL” field. Now click on the “call to action” menu button and select a “call to action” button to insert on your ad. There are several types of “call to action” buttons available that you can insert according to the offer or content in the destination URL. You can also select “no button” if you don’t want to add a “call to action” button to your ad. Now that your ad is finished, check the preview window to see how your ad will look like on different placements. Next, click on the “review” button to review your campaign settings, and click on “confirm” to launch your campaign. Your ad will be reviewed by the ad approval team and will launch in around 5 to 15 minutes after you submit it. <br>And that’s it!<br><br><a href="CHAPTER = 9.html">&lt;&lt; CHAPTER = 9</a> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="CHAPTER = 11.html">CHAPTER = 11 &gt;&gt;</a></h3>
