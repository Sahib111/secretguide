Split Test Your Posts And Ads It is a good idea to test two or more variations of the same ad or post, directed at different segments of the same audience.

While you can get away with an additional post when you need to make an announcement or participate in a trending topic, posting too many times can put your audience off quickly. <strong>✕</strong> Don’t Argue With Unsatisfied Customers Don’t reply with an angry comment to a rude customer, or when someone leaves you a low-score review. Simply reply in a professional matter and try to help fix their problem. <br><strong>✕</strong> Don’t Be Slow To Respond Or Engage Facebook users expect a quick response to their comments and to the messages they send to your pages.

Instead of going over budget, simply set up your campaigns correctly, optimize your ads, and wait for engagement to build. <br><strong>✕</strong> Don’t Target Too Broadly If you’re tempted to target a broad audience in hopes of interacting with a large number of people, don’t. The larger the audience, the more people that will end up ignoring your ads. <br><strong>✕</strong> Simply target the people interested in what you have to offer, and you’ll do great!   Don’t Over Promote While the ultimate goal of your business is to make a profit, you can’t focus your marketing campaigns on driving sales or promoting your products. Instead, feed your audience with content that helps them solve their problems, and they’ll become customers. <br><strong>✕</strong> Don’t Spam Don’t use Facebook pages or brand identity to go around sharing links on public groups, pages, and Messenger inboxes. <br><strong>✕</strong> Don’t Ignore The Facebook Terms and Conditions Ignoring Facebook terms of use is an easy way to violate a rule, and get your account suspended without knowing why, so make sure to read it all before you run a marketing campaign, and before you create an ad.&nbsp;<br><br><a href="CHAPTER = 16.html">&lt;&lt; CHAPTER = 16</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="CHAPTER = 18.html">CHAPTER = 18 &gt;&gt;</a></h3>
