                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-5">Now that we got over the engagement strategies, let’s move on into the lead generation strategies. When it comes to Latest Facebook Marketing, the most effective lead generation strategies are all about encouraging intent by giving away to people something that is hard to resist. Giveaways are an easy way to achieve this, and in this lesson, we are going to show you the easiest, most effective way to set up giveaways that collect leads for you, and that also send people to your Facebook pages. Ready? Yes? Then let’s get started. <br><br><strong>Getting Started </strong><br>Our recommended, stress-free method to set up giveaways is by joining a giveaways platform. There are several to choose from, but most are paid, so in this lesson we are going to recommend you to use “Gleam”, a marketing platform that lets you create and run beautiful giveaways with no overhead costs, and that doesn’t require a credit card to get started. To join Gleam, simply visit the “gleam.io” URL, click on the “sign up” button, and complete the registration steps. <br><br><strong>Setting Up The Giveaway Campaign</strong><strong><br></strong>Alright folks let’s start this step on your dashboard, right after you register on the platform. First, click on the “new competition” button to start creating the giveaway. Next, enter the name of the giveaway campaign into the “name” field. Now use the calendar functions below to select the date when the giveaway “starts” and when it “ends”. Now select the correct “time zone” for your giveaway. Now enter your giveaway terms and conditions into the “terms and conditions” field. Also, click on the “captcha” menu button and select “always require a captcha” to stop bots from spamming your competition. Now click on the “user details” tab. Click on the “minimum age” menu button and select “18+ checkbox”. Now delete all options in the “allow login” section except “email” and “Facebook”. Next, enter your Facebook page URL into the “allow users to like a Facebook page” field. Then make sure that the “Build Competition Subscriber list” option is checked, and click on the “how to enter” tab.   On this page you are going to click on the “Facebook” icon, and then you are going to select the “Facebook entry” method. In the “Facebook entry” section, select “like a page”. Then, enter your Facebook page URL and your Facebook Page ID into the fields below. Now check the “mandatory” option, and click on the “prize” tab. Here you are going to enter the name of your prize into the “widget title” field, and then a description of your prize into the “description” field. Now you are going to enter the number of winners into the “number of winners” field. Launching The Giveaway Campaign Now that your giveaway campaign is fully personalized, you can click on the “save” button to launch it. <br>And that’s it!
