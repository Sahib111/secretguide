<p style="font-size:40px"><u>How does it work?</u></p>
<img src="assets/images/002.jpg" style="width: 325.578px; height: 272px; float: right;">Facebook Marketing works primarily by building a social presence for your brand that users can interact with. This means you are going to create a profile for your business the same you would create a profile for yourself. In fact, the Facebook Marketing mindset is similar to the personal brand mindset: you create a page for your business that people can Like or Follow, where you are going to publish posts that sound casual and engaging to make it easier for people to interact with your brand. Once you establish a presence and build a following, you are going to raise awareness about your products, services, and offers by curating branded content from your website or other content channel. Right after you can start promoting your stuff a little more aggressively through contests and by sharing promotions such as discounts to get your audience interested in your stuff. Then you can start using Facebook features for businesses, such as Facebook ads and Facebook remarketing.Why should you consider Facebook for Marketing? The most primary reason for using Facebook as a marketing tool is it is still the most visited, most active social media site that exists, with over a billion active users a month. This means that finding the perfect audience for your business is easier on Facebook. Facebook itself provides you with plenty of tools to engage your audience, including business pages, groups, chat, live video, and multimedia posts. They also gives you all the flexibility you need to promote your brand and to send traffic from your pages and groups to your website. Plus, Facebook has what is perhaps the second largest and most cost-effective advertising platform on the internet. <br><br>
